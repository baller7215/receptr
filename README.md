# Receptr

Receptr is a mobile application designed to help users track expenses by scanning and categorizing receipts. The app utilizes **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** to extract text from receipts and provides an intuitive interface for managing expenses.

## Features

- **React Native App** â€“ Built with React Native for a smooth mobile experience.
- **Receipt Scanning (OCR) - In Progress** â€“ Uses Tesseract OCR and OpenCV to extract data from scanned receipts.
- **Expense Categorization - In Progress** â€“ Allows users to tag and sort expenses for easy tracking.
- **Authentication - In Progress** â€“ Secure user authentication with JWT and bcrypt.
- **Backend API** â€“ Built with Django and PostgreSQL for handling data storage and user accounts.
- **Dockerized Backend** â€“ The backend runs in a Docker container for easy setup and deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native, Redux, TanStack Query
- **Backend:** Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL
- **OCR Processing:** Tesseract OCR, OpenCV
- **Authentication:** JWT, bcrypt
